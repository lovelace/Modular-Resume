\begin{itemize}
	\item Fine-tuned large language models for social science applications, e.g. measuring political slant.
	\item Built \href{https://github.com/petezh/OpenD5}{OpenD5}, a meta-dataset of 700 interdisciplinary tasks, \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14233}{submitted} 2nd-author to ICML '23.
	\item Improved and assessed hypothesis discovery algorithm, achieving 5-100x speedups and improving insight.
	\item Experimenting with novel applications of language models for collaborative forecasting and decision-making.
